 * and downstream consumers all match on that text. The typed fields are
 * strictly additive — read them instead of re-parsing `message`.
 *
 * Note `streamKiro` does not reject with this error: per the pi-ai stream
 * contract it encodes failures into the returned stream. The typed fields reach
 * consumers through the terminal `error` event's
 * `AssistantMessage.diagnostics` entry of type `kiro_api_error`, whose
 * `details` mirror `status` / `reasonCode` / `retryAfterMs` / `providerAttempts`.
 * The HTTP status is also set as `AssistantMessage.errorStatus`, the field Oh My
 * Pi reads; on a host without pi-ai's diagnostic helpers it is the only one.
